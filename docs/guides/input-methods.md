# Input Methods

## Control Method Guide

Set the control method with:

```ini
input_method = WIN32
```

Valid values:

```text
WIN32, GHUB, RAZER, ARDUINO, RP2350, TEENSY41_HID, KMBOX_NET, KMBOX_A, MAKCU
```

Hardware methods are explicit. If you select `RAZER` or `TEENSY41_HID` and the matching runtime is not available, the app does not switch to another method for you.

## When WIN32 Does Not Move In Game

`WIN32` sends standard Windows mouse events through the normal Win32 input path. This is useful for a quick desktop test, but some games ignore or block this kind of synthetic input. In that case detection can work, the preview can show boxes, and the GUI can open with `Home`, but aim movement or auto-shoot still will not reach the game.

Treat this as an input-chain problem, not a model or capture problem:

1. Confirm boxes or preview detections are visible.
2. Confirm the console prints the expected line, for example `[Mouse] Using WIN32 input.`
3. Test whether movement works on the Windows desktop or in a non-blocking app.
4. If desktop movement works but the game does not react, switch away from `WIN32`.
5. Use a method that matches the runtime or device you actually have: `GHUB`, `RAZER`, `ARDUINO`, `RP2350`, `TEENSY41_HID`, `KMBOX_NET`, `KMBOX_A`, or `MAKCU`.

For games that block the standard Win32 path, a separate supported input device is usually required. Hardware-style methods such as Arduino/RP2350/Teensy, KMBOX, or MAKCU send movement through an external bridge instead of relying on normal Windows synthetic mouse events. The app does not create this device for you; it must be connected, configured, and visible to the selected `input_method`.

## Razer Setup

Use:

```ini
input_method = RAZER
```

The runtime wrapper loads:

```text
rzctl.dll
```

Expected project path:

```text
sunone_aimbot_2\rzctl.dll
```

The DLL can also be placed beside `ai.exe`. If the DLL is missing or exports are wrong, Razer movement will not work and no fallback control method is used.

Quick checks:

- Confirm the DLL filename is exactly `rzctl.dll`.
- Confirm it is the same architecture as the app, usually x64.
- Confirm `input_method = RAZER`.
- Watch console logs for `[Razer]` messages.

## Teensy 4.1 RawHID Setup

Use:

```ini
input_method = TEENSY41_HID
```

Default HID filters:

```ini
teensy_hid_serial = AUTO
teensy_hid_vid_filter = AUTO
teensy_hid_pid_filter = AUTO
teensy_hid_usage_page = 65451
teensy_hid_usage_id = 512
teensy_hid_open_index = 0
```

The firmware must match the expected RawHID-style packet interface. The current path sends report-ID-prefixed 64-byte packets.

Button mapping used by the control path:

| Button ID | Meaning |
|---:|---|
| `1` | Shoot / left mouse. |
| `2` | Zoom / right mouse. |
| `5` | Aiming / side button state. |

Quick checks:

- Confirm the Teensy is visible as a HID device.
- Start with all filters set to `AUTO`.
- If multiple matching devices exist, adjust `teensy_hid_open_index`.
- Watch console logs for `[Mouse] Using TEENSY41_HID input.`
